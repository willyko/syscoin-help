## **`listunspent`**

**`listunspent ( minconf maxconf  ["addresses",...] [include_unsafe] )`**

Returns array of unspent transaction outputs
with between minconf and maxconf (inclusive) confirmations.
Optionally filter to only include txouts paid to specified addresses.

***Arguments:***

```
1. minconf          (numeric, optional, default=1) The minimum confirmations to filter
2. maxconf          (numeric, optional, default=9999999) The maximum confirmations to filter
3. "addresses"      (string) A json array of syscoin addresses to filter
    [
      "address"     (string) syscoin address
      ,...
    ]
4. include_unsafe (bool, optional, default=true) Include outputs that are not safe to spend
                  because they come from unconfirmed untrusted transactions or unconfirmed
                  replacement transactions (cases where we are less sure that a conflicting
                  transaction won't be mined).

```

```
